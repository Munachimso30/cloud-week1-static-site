  <h1>About this project</h1>

  <h2>Static site on Amazon S3</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a simple static website built with plain HTML files.
    The files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that has static website hosting enabled,
    so S3 can serve <code>index.html</code> and other pages directly.
  </p>

  <h2>Public access with bucket policy</h2>
  <p>
    By default, S3 buckets are private. To make this site publicly readable, I disabled
    the “Block all public access” setting for this bucket and added a bucket policy that
    allows the s3:GetObject action for everyone on all objects in the bucket.
    This makes the HTML files accessible over the internet, but still read-only.
  </p>

  <h2>CloudFront in front of S3</h2>
  <p>
    A CloudFront distribution sits in front of the S3 website endpoint.
    CloudFront caches my pages at edge locations around the world and serves them over HTTPS.
    This improves performance and security compared to using the raw S3 website URL.
